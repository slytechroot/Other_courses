A good Red Team Overview document:

Red Team Program Goals:
Here are some references that you can use to derive your Red Team program goals from. These will serve as the foundation for building your Red Team charter.

Red Team Technical Goals:
If you are just looking for some really generic goals that you can use to measure the performance of technical people I think you should consider:

Task 1: Integrate Blue Team/Threat Intel data

Task 1a: Work with Blue Team and Threat Intel (Internal and/or External) to understand the threats facing the organization, and its assets. 
Task 1b: Then craft attack campaigns that emulate these threats/threat actors. 
               Reference:
              https://www.slideshare.net/HaydnJohnson/how-to-plan-purple-team-exercises
Task 1c: Theorize how Blue Team/SOC should be able to detect these types of threats. 
Task 1d: Work with Blue Team/SOC representatives so they can understand the campaign objectives

Interval:                                      Quarterly: 
Evaluation Criteria:                     How well does the RT work with the other teams to create realistic campaigns


Task 2: Attempt to avoid detection during campaigns

Task 2a: Work with Blue Team/SOC to determine how the Red Team was detected if at all (External gateway security appliance, proxy solution, network security appliance, AV, endpoint security solution, etc). 
Task 2b: Determine how well the RT was able to determine what tool/process should have detected them
Task 2c: Determine how well the Blue Team/SOC was able to tune their processes to detect the RT campaign 
Task 2d: Work with Blue Team/SOC representatives so they can understand the campaign objectives

Interval:                                      Quarterly: 
Evaluation Criteria:                     How well does the RT successfully accomplish the campaign objectives
                                                   How well does the RT assist the Blue Team/SOC with improving detection/IR processes, and tuning of security products


Task 3: Build internal knowledge base

Task 3a: Build an internal knowledge base that contains system build/configuration info for the entire Red Team Infrastructure
              Reference:

              https://ired.team/offensive-security/red-team-infrastructure

Task 3b: Build an internal attack process wiki that has all of the command-line syntax, and references used for each campaign

Task 3c: Build an internal R&D process

Interval:                                      Quarterly: 
Evaluation Criteria:                     How thorough is the documentation, how well can this documentation be used for on-boarding new RT members
                                                   How well does the RT assist the Blue Team/SOC with improving detection/IR processes, and tuning of security products against attacks
